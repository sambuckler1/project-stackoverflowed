Overview

This project ingests Walmart product data, enriches it with UPCs, and then matches those UPCs against Amazon's catalog using the Amazon Selling Partner API (SP-API).
- enriching upc's is done independently of grabbing the data from walmart because it exists in the PDP data, not the JSON returned from a normal serp search

Goal: identify price arbitrage opportunities between Walmart and Amazon.
Current Architecture (SerpAPI) 
Step 1: Scrape Walmart items via SerpAPI (Google results for site:walmart.com + query).
Step 2: For each Walmart product, run another SerpAPI query on Amazon.
Step 3: Try to match titles/brands/prices.

Problem: Consumed 1 SerpAPI request per product per platform → very expensive, limited quota. Also error-prone because of fuzzy title matches.

New Architecture To be implemented (SP-API + UPC Matching) (***NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
We now rely on canonical identifiers:
Walmart Scraper
Ingest products from Walmart by category/query.
Store in MongoDB with fields: title, price, brand, link, thumbnail, product_id, upc.
UPC enrichment can happen via Walmart API responses (where available) or secondary scrapers.
UPC → Amazon ASIN
Use SP-API Catalog Items v2022-04-01 endpoint:

GET /catalog/2022-04-01/items
  ?identifiers=<UPC>
  &identifiersType=UPC
  &marketplaceIds=ATVPDKIKX0DER


Returns ASIN(s) + attributes.
Amazon Price Lookup
With ASIN(s), call SP-API Product Pricing API to get current buybox price and offers.
Deal Matching
Compare Walmart price vs Amazon price.
Expose through FastAPI (/deals/by-title, /deals/by-upc) and Node/Next.js frontend dashboard.

Data Flow
[Frontend Dashboard]
      ↓
[Node Backend (/api/amazon/...)]
      ↓
[FastAPI Python service (scrapers, deal engine)]
      ↓
[MongoDB]


Dashboard: Triggers "Ingest Walmart" and "Find Deals".
Node Backend: Forwards requests to FastAPI service.
FastAPI: Handles scraping, enrichment, Amazon API queries, and deal logic.
MongoDB: Stores Walmart items, Amazon cache, matched deals.

Key Endpoints
Walmart

POST /walmart/scrape → scrape Walmart category/query.
POST /walmart/enrich-upc?limit=100 → fill in missing UPCs for Walmart items.
GET /walmart/items → view stored items.

Amazon

POST /index-by-title (legacy fuzzy match) → got rid of this, because title matching caused false comparisons (different sized items, bundle deals vs single, etc)
POST /index-by-upc (new) → lookup ASINs via SP-API Catalog Items.
GET /deals/by-upc → compare Walmart UPC vs Amazon ASINs.

Why This Is Better

No more SerpAPI bill blowups — SP-API is free (with limits).
UPC is a canonical identifier → much higher accuracy than title fuzzy match.
Scalable: One Walmart scrape → enrich UPCs → batch Amazon lookups.


Dev Notes

You need SP-API credentials:
Seller Central account, app registration, LWA credentials, AWS IAM role.
MarketplaceId for US: ATVPDKIKX0DER.
Test mode: SP-API sandbox gives static data until you’re approved for live.

Mongo collections:
walmart_items
amazon_cache (ASINs, UPC, pricing snapshot)
deals

Next Steps / TODO

Implement index-by-upc in FastAPI (main.py). Fix this function, and fix /deals/by-upc (last 2 functions in main.py) this is likely where the problems are

Update Node backend amazonRoutes.js to forward index-by-upc.

Update dashboard to let users choose “Find Deals (UPC)” vs “Find Deals (Title)”.

Add logging + retry for SP-API throttling (very likely).

✅ With this setup, anyone coming in will understand that UPC is the golden key. Walmart gives us the UPC, Amazon SP-API resolves UPC → ASIN, then we pull price and compare. Much cleaner.
